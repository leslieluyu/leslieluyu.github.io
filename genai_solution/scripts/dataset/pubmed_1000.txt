Inactivation was preceded by a bleaching due to rapid reduction of Cu2+ on the enzyme, and following this there was a gradual reappearance of a new absorption in the visible region, which was coincident with the loss of catalytic activity. Inactivation of the enzyme was pH-dependent and indicated an essential ionization whose pKa was approximately 10.2.

Several compounds, including xanthine, urate, formate, and azide, protected the enzyme against inactivation by H2O2. Alcohols and benzoate, which scavenge hydroxyl radical, did not protect. Compounds with special affinity for singlet oxygen were similarly ineffective.

Inactivation was preceded by a bleaching due to rapid reduction of Cu2+ on the enzyme, and following this there was a gradual reappearance of a new absorption in the visible region, which was coincident with the loss of catalytic activity. Inactivation of the enzyme was pH-dependent and indicated an essential ionization whose pKa was approximately 10.2. Replacement of H2O by D2O raised this pKa but did not diminish the catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase, measured at pH 10.0. Several compounds, including xanthine, urate, formate, and azide, protected the enzyme against inactivation by H2O2. Alcohols and benzoate, which scavenge hydroxyl radical, did not protect. Compounds with special affinity for singlet oxygen were similarly ineffective. The data were interpreted in terms of the reduction of the enzyme-bound Cu2+ to Cu+, by H2O2, followed by a Fenton's type reaction of the Cu+ with additional H2O2. This would generate Cu2+-OH- or its ionized equivalent, Cu2+-O--, which could then oxidatively attack an adjacent histidine and thus inactivate the enzyme. Compounds which protected the enzyme could have done so by reacting with the bound oxidant, in competition with the adjacent histidine.", "PMID": 49}

(Brenchley, J.E., Prival, M.J. and Magasanik, B. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6122-6128) for isolating histidase-constitutive mutants of a non-N2-fixing bacterium. 2. Nitrogenase levels of the new mutants in the presence of NH4+ were as high as 100% of the nitrogenase activity detected in the absence of NH4+. 3. Biochemical characterization of these nitrogen fixation (nif) derepressed mutants reveals that they fall into three classes. Three mutants (strains SK-24, 28 and 29), requiring glutamate for growth, synthesize nitrogenase and glutamine synthetase constitutively (in the presence of NH4+). A second class of mutants (strains SK-27 and 37) requiring glutamine for growth produces derepressed levels of nitrogenase activity and synthesized catalytically inactive glutamine synthetase protein, as determined immunologically. A third class of glutamine-requiring, nitrogenase-derepressed mutants (strain SK-25 and 26) synthesizes neither a catalytically active glutamine synthetase enzyme nor an immunologically cross-reactive glutamine synthetase protein. 4. F-prime complementation analysis reveals that the mutant strains SK-25, 26, 27, 37 map in a segment of the Klebsiella chromosome corresponding to the region coding for glutamine synthetase. Since the mutant strains SK-27 and SK-37 produce inactive glutamine synthetase protein, it is concluded that these mutations map within the glutamine synthetase structural gene.", "PMID": 59}

Pseudomonas atlantica when grown on agar produces two specific enzymes, p-nitrophenyl alpha-galactose hydrolase and neoagarobiose hydrolase. The purification and partial characterization of both enzymes are presented.", "PMID": 137}

Acute respiratory acidosis (PO2 = 30 mm Hg, PCO2 = 81 mm Hg, pH = 7.17) and lactic acidosis and hypoxemia (PO2 = 32 mm Hg, PCO2 = 21 mm Hg, pH = 6.96) did not significantly alter this relation. Transformation of the conductance-hematocrit data indicated that hematocrit was the most important determinant of relative apparent viscosity of the blood. Both acute respiratory and lactic acidosis failed to significantly increase relative viscosity within the range of hematocrit usually found in secondary polycythemia.", "PMID": 154}

When the heart rate was constant, intracarotidly administered nicotine induced an increase in the depth of respiration followed closely by an increase in late diastolic coronary flow from 48 +/- 2 to 106 +/- 8 ml/min and a reduction in late diastolic coronary resistance from 1.62 +/- 0.08 to 0.78 +/- 0.06 mm Hg/ml min-1.

At Lmax (the length of the muscle at which developed tension was maximum) under identical conditions of temperature, rate of stimulation, ionic milieu, pH, and O2 and CO2 supply, right atrial trabeculae achieved the same developed and total tensions but in a much shorter time than did ventricular trabeculae. In both muscle groups the maximum developed tension averaged about 2.5 g/mm2. Since Lo (expressed as a fraction of Lmax) was less in atrial muscle than it was in ventribular muscle, we concluded that atrial muscle can be stretched considerably more than can ventricular muscle before optimum length is reached.

The addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) to sheep erythrocytes preincubated with sphingomyelinase C was found to induce rapid hemolysis at 37 C.

Staphylococcus aureus produces a phospholipase C specific for sphingomyelin (beta-hemolysin). Erythrocytes with approximately 50% sphingomyelin in their membranes, e.g., from sheep, have been shown to have up to 60% of this phospholipid hydrolyzed by this enzyme at 37 C in isotonic buffered saline without hemolysis. Cooling of sphingomyelinase C-treated erythrocytes to 4 C causes complete lysis of the cells, a phenomenon known as hot-cold hemolysis. The addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) to sheep erythrocytes preincubated with sphingomyelinase C was found to induce rapid hemolysis at 37 C.

A study of the trophic effects of Su-13437 on rat liver.", "content": "Peroxisome proliferation has been induced with 2-methyl-2-(p-[1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl]-phenoxy)-propionic acid (Su-13437). DNA, protein, cytochrome oxidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and acid phosphatase concentrations remain almost constant. Peroxisomal enzyme activities change to approximately 165%, 50%, 30%, and 0% of the controls for catalase, urate oxidase, L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, and D-amino acid oxidase, respectively. For catalase the change results from a decrease in particle-bound activity and a fivefold increase in soluble activity. The average diameter of peroxisome sections is 0.58 +/- 0.15 mum in controls and 0.73 +/- 0.25 mum after treatment. Therefore, the measured peroxisomal enzymes are highly diluted in proliferated particles. After tissue fractionation, approximately one-half of the normal peroxisomes and all proliferated peroxisomes show matric extraction with ghost formation, but no change in size. In homogenates submitted to mechanical stress, proliferated peroxisomes do not reveal increased fragility; unexpectedly, Su-13437 stabilizes lysosomes. Our results suggest that matrix extraction and increased soluble enzyme activities result from transmembrane passage of peroxisomal proteins.

A new cytochemical technique for the localization of H2O2, a product of NADH oxidase activity, was developed. Cerous ions, in the presence of peroxide, form an electron-dense precipitate. Resting and phagocytically stimulated PMN were exposed to cerous ions at pH 7.5 to demonstrate sites of NADH-dependent, cyanide-insensitive H2O2 production. Resting PMN exhibites slight activity on the plasma membrane; phagocytizing PMN had extensive deposits of reaction product localized within the phagosome and on the plasma membrane.

The results, therefore, show distinct and complicated dose-dependent patterns of intermediary metabolism that cannot be explained completely by any one hypothesis but that imply significant dose-dependent effects of ethanol upon intermediary metabolism not directly related to NADH production.", "PMID": 422}

In a 0.1-M Tris-HC1 buffer pH 7.4, the solubility of accurately sized CPPD crystals (37-20mum) was 60muM with maximal solubility being attained after about 8 h incubation at 37degreeC. Reduction in crystal size, decrease in pH, increase in ionic strength, Mg++, citrate, and albumin all increased solubility. The most marked effects on solubility occurred when changing the calcium concentration or by enzymatic hydrolysis of inoganic pyrophosphate to orthophosphate. It was found that decreasing the ionized calcium level below 5 mg/100 ml resulted in a progressive enhancement of solubility. The observed solubility-enhancing effects of albumin could be explained solely on its calcium-binding ability and thereby, altered ionized calcium level.

{"id": "pubmed23n0001_257", "title": "Photoreceptor processes: some problems and perspectives.", "content": "Visual photoreceptors from both vertebrates and invertebrates are characterized by extensive elaboration of membrane which contains visual pigment (rhodopsin). Visual pigments in all phyla examined are chemically similar: the chromophore is 11-cis retinaldehyde attached by an aldimine linkage (Schiff base) to a membrane protein, opsin. The effect of light is to isomerize the chromophore to the all-trans configuration. Beyond these fundamental similarities, several specific areas are discussed in which variations and differences appear. (1) Light causes vertebrate visual pigments to bleach, liberating the chromophore. Most invertebrate visual pigments do not bleach in the light, but instead form a thermally stable metarhodopsin, with the chromophore in the all-trans configuration still attached to the opsin. (2) In the disk membranes of vertebrate rod and cone outer segments, the rhodopsin molecules are oriented with their chromophores nearly coplanar with the disks. Within this plane, however, both rotational and translational diffusion are possible.

In no single case are they adequately understood.", "contents": "Photoreceptor processes: some problems and perspectives. Visual photoreceptors from both vertebrates and invertebrates are characterized by extensive elaboration of membrane which contains visual pigment (rhodopsin). Visual pigments in all phyla examined are chemically similar: the chromophore is 11-cis retinaldehyde attached by an aldimine linkage (Schiff base) to a membrane protein, opsin. The effect of light is to isomerize the chromophore to the all-trans configuration. Beyond these fundamental similarities, several specific areas are discussed in which variations and differences appear. (1) Light causes vertebrate visual pigments to bleach, liberating the chromophore. Most invertebrate visual pigments do not bleach in the light, but instead form a thermally stable metarhodopsin, with the chromophore in the all-trans configuration still attached to the opsin. (2) In the disk membranes of vertebrate rod and cone outer segments, the rhodopsin molecules are oriented with their chromophores nearly coplanar with the disks. Within this plane, however, both rotational and translational diffusion are possible. In the microvillar membranes of arthropod and cephalopod rhabdoms, on the other hand, the situation is less clear.

Experiments were conducted on healthy unanesthetized fetuses, intact in utero, with catheters implanted at hysterotomy into a fetal femoral artery and vein and into the bladder via the urachus, four or more days prior to the study. A metabolic acidosis was induced by infusion of isotonic lactic acid, 15 m mole/kg, intravenously over a period of 90 minutes. Serial arterial samples were taken and urine collected in fractions before, during and for three hours following the infusion, for measurements of pH, bicarbonate, lactate and electrolytes as well as urine output. During the infusion, urine pH fell from 6.65 to 6.25 and was 6.34 three hours later (Figs. 1 to 4, Tabs. III to IV). Lactic acid infusion caused a prompt increase in urine output from a mean rate of 0.12 to a maximum of 0.28 ml/kg/min at the end of the infusion, returning to control rates three hours later. Lactate excretion increased from 0.05 to a maximum of 4.6 mumole/kg/min at the end of infusion; titratable acid increased from 0.22 to a maximum of 4 muEq/kg/min; the rates of excretion of lactate and titratable acid were still higher than control at the end of three hours. Ammonia excretion increased from 0.21 to a maximum of 0.56 muEq/kg/min three hours after the end of infusion. The acid infusion caused a small but significant fall in excretion of bicarbonate. During the 90 minutes of infusion and over the following three hours, about 800 mumole lactate was excreted while net acid excretion over the same period was no more than half that amount. The diuresis was also accompanied by a net loss of sodium and chloride, the excretion of these ions increasing more than threefold following acid infusion; excretion of potassium decreased to one-third its rate prior to the infusion. During the 90 minutes of infusion, blood pH fell from 7.36 to 7.13, base deficit rose from 3.8 to 16.4 mEq/L and lactate rose from 2.2 to 14.8 mM/L; there was also a small but significant rise in both blood PCO2 and PO2 (Figs. 1 to 2, Tabs.

After injection of alpha-MMT (100 mg/kg i.p.), the striatal concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) rose by 41% at 1 hour. This is probably due to an increase in DA metabolism, since alpha-MMT markedly enhanced the decline of DA produced by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT). At 2, 3 and 4 hours after alpha-MMT, the concentration of HVA and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was below control level. The decrease in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid is due partially to a decreased formation of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid from DA. In striatal slices, both alpha-MMT and alpha-MMTA decreased the formation of 3H-H2O and the accumulation of 3H-DA from 1-3,5-3H-tyrosine. Alpha-MMT did not alter the specific activity of 3H-tyrosine or release 3H-DA from the slices, but it did inhibit the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in striatal homogenates at low concentrations of tyrosine (10 muM). Alpha-MMTA released both newly synthesized and exogenously accumulated 3H-DA from striatal slices. At low concentrations of alpha-MMTA, the percent reduction in 3H-H2O was much greater than the percentage of 3H-DA released into the medium. However, at higher concentrations, the inhibition of 3H-H2O reached a maximum while 3H-DA release kept increasing. These results suggest that both inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and DA release from storage sites by alpha-MMTA may account for the depletion of DA produced by the injection of alpha-MMT.", "contents": "Studies on the mechanism of depletion of striatal dopamine by alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine. These experiments were designed to study the mechanism of depletion of dopamine (DA) in the striatum produced by alpha-methyl-m-tyrosine (alpha-MMT). alpha-Methyl-m-tyramine (alpha-MMTA), the metabolite of alpha-MMT, appears to be the active DA-depleting agent, since the administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor before alpha-MMT markedly reduced both the formation of alpha-MMTA and the depletion of DA. After injection of alpha-MMT (100 mg/kg i.p.), the striatal concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA) rose by 41% at 1 hour. This is probably due to an increase in DA metabolism, since alpha-MMT markedly enhanced the decline of DA produced by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha-MPT). At 2, 3 and 4 hours after alpha-MMT, the concentration of HVA and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was below control level. The decrease in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid is due partially to a decreased formation of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid from DA. In striatal slices, both alpha-MMT and alpha-MMTA decreased the formation of 3H-H2O and the accumulation of 3H-DA from 1-3,5-3H-tyrosine. Alpha-MMT did not alter the specific activity of 3H-tyrosine or release 3H-DA from the slices, but it did inhibit the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in striatal homogenates at low concentrations of tyrosine (10 muM). Alpha-MMTA released both newly synthesized and exogenously accumulated 3H-DA from striatal slices. At low concentrations of alpha-MMTA, the percent reduction in 3H-H2O was much greater than the percentage of 3H-DA released into the medium. However, at higher concentrations, the inhibition of 3H-H2O reached a maximum while 3H-DA release kept increasing. These results suggest that both inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase activity and DA release from storage sites by alpha-MMTA may account for the depletion of DA produced by the injection of alpha-MMT.", "PMID": 490}

A study has been made of the formation of synapses in developing reinnervated and cross-reinnervated amphibian twitch muscles which receive either a focal (iliofibularis) or a distributed (sartorius) innervation from 'en plaque' nerve terminals using histological, ultrastructural and electrophysiological techniques. 2.

Furthermore, the degree of immunosuppression seen in this study is not of the order of magnitude that one could reasonably predict a significant decrease in mean life-span.", "PMID": 562}

Thus, it is apparent that ubiquinone-1 shunts electrons from NADH dehydrogenase [NADH:(acceptor)oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.99.3] to the portion of the respiratory chain containing the energy-coupling site. The findings demonstrate unequivocally that inefficient coupling of NADH oxidation to active transport cannot be due to the presence of inverted vesicles. In addition, they provide further support for specific localization of the energy-coupling site.", "PMID": 672}

Treatment of lethally irradiated mice with syngeneic or allogeneic newborn thymus cells or allogeneic newborn or adult spleen cells regularly led to fatal secondary disease or graft-versus-host reactions. Treatment of the lethally irradiated mice with fetal liver cells regularly yielded long-lived, immunologically vigorous chimeras. The introduction of the fetal liver cells into the irradiated mice appeared to be followed by development of immunological tolerance of the donor cells. The findings suggest that T-cells at an early stage of differentiation are more susceptible to tolerance induction than are T-lymphocytes at later stages of differentiation. These investigations turned up a perplexing paradox which suggests that high doses of irradiation may injure the thymic stroma, rendering it less capable of supporting certain T-cell populations in the peripheral lymphoid tissue. Alternatively, the higher and not the lower dose of irradiation may have eliminated a host cell not readily derived from fetal liver precursors which represents an important helper cell in certain cell-mediated immune functions, e.g., graft-versus-host reactions, but which is not important in others, e.g., allograft rejections. The higher dose of lethal irradiation did not permit development or maintenance of a population of spleen cells that could initiate graft-versus-host reactions but did permit the development of a population of donor cells capable of achieving vigorous allograft rejection.

A simplified method for the calculation of erythrocyte bicarbonate concentration using the experimentally determined red cell pK'1 value has been formulated. The method involves the use of a regression equation relating plasma and red cell pH, the equivalence of plasma and red cell PCO2, along with the experimentally determined red cell pK'1.", "PMID": 752}

The response to an increase in PICO2 from 0.3 to 5.2 mm Hg was a five-fold increase in gill ventilation volume and a slight increase in breathing frequency. There was a concomitant rise in PACO2 and an immediate fall in pHa. If PICO2 was maintained at 5.2 mm Hg for several days, ventilation volume gradually returned to the initial, prehypercapnic level within three days. Arterial pH also returned to the initial level within 2-3 days. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that under these conditions fish regulate pH via HCO3/C1 exchange across the gills rather than by changes in ventilation and subsequent adjustment of PACO2. A reduction in environmental pH causes a reduction in pHa but only a slow gradual increase in VG. Injections of HC1 or NaHCO3 into the blood have opposite effects on pHa but both cause a marked increase in VG.

An increase in CSF lactate and L/P ratio in hemorrhagic CSF seems to be caused by two different factors. Shed blood cells per se produce lactate and pyruvate, and blood in the subarachnoid space and intracerebral hematomas cause secondary changes in brain tissue metabolism by a probable reduction of cerebral blood flow. Therefore, an increase in CSF lactate with a concomitant rise in CSF L/P ratio is a useful indicator for brain tissue hypoxia, even when CSF is hemorrhagic. The association of an increase in CSF lactate to a disproportionate decrease in CSF HCO-3 was also observed in these animals.", "PMID": 822}

The development of the neurons of the substantia nigra and their axons which project to the neostriatum has been presented from their appearance at day 14 of gestation to their maturation in early postnatal life. The initial bipolar neuroblasts, which develop in the midline of the caudal mesencephalon, are fluorescent as soon as they emerge from the ependymal zone.

This fact evidences for identity of riboflavin precursors in the yeast P. guilliermondii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthesis of DOARAP by the washed off cells of the mutants with the blocked lumasine synthetase is strongly inhibited by riboflavin; cycloheximide in the absence of riboflavin has no effect on this process.

Hypoxia was induced by decreasing the oxygen content in the inspired gas mixture either to 6-7 per cent or to 2.5-3 per cent. This reduced mean PaO2 to about 25 and 11-12 torr, respectively. At PaO2 torr, there was no change in cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebrla oxygen consumption (CMRO2), or labile tissue metabolites. The absence of signs of cerebral hypoxia could be attributed to an effect of temperature and pH on the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve. Thus, at 27 C with a PaO2 of 25 torr the total oxygen content (TO2) of arterial blood remained greater than 15 ml (100 ml)-1, about three times the value obtained at this PO2 in normothermic rats. At PaO2 11-12 torr, arterial TO2 was reduced to about 5 ml (100 ml) (-1). The hypoxia induced no change in CMRO2, a threefold increase in CBF, a moderate lactacidosis in the tissue, and a small decrease in phosphocreatine content, but no change in ATP, ADP, or AMP. These changes are less marked than those occurring at the same arterial TO2 in normothermic rats. It is concluded that hypothermia exerts a pronounced protective effect on the brain in hypoxic hypoxia, and that two mechanisms are involved. First, since hypothermia shifts the oxyhemoglobin-dissociation curve towards the left, and prevents or minimizes a rightward shift due to acidosis, it maintains a high TO2 in arterial blood at a given PaO2.

Ten dogs with one lobe or more of pneumonia increased their pulmonary vascular resistances and slightly decreased their arterial O2 tensions. Hypoxia increased and hyperoxia decreased their pulmonary vascular resistances. During O2 breathing, arterial PO2 was less during than before the pneumonia and increased when pulmonary perfusion was diverted away from the diseased lung. In 2 dogs breathing air, forcing the cardiac output through the diseased lung caused an increase in vascular resistance that could clearly be reduced by O2 breathing. In 5 dogs, lung mast cell counts showed no decrease in the lobes with pneumonia.

In Tris-CHl containing 1 mm-NaF, stimulation of incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids by noradrenaline was enhanced by ATP, CaCl2, MgCl2 and CoA plus dithiothreitol. The optimum concentration of CaCl2 for stimulation by 10 mum-noradrenaline was 10 mum. In the presence of CaCl2, the optimum concentration of ATP-2MgCl2 was in the range 0.1-1 mm. Acetylcholine, carbamoylcholine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, histamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid also stimulated the incorporation of oleate into choline glycerophospholipids of synaptic membranes. Sigmoidal dose-response curves were obtained, similar to those obtained previously for stimulation by the same agonists of the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by phospholipase A2 (Gullis &amp; Rowe, 1975a).

Formation of N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide as an unstable product of the nitrosation in dilute aqueous-acidic solution. Reaction of phenacetin with N2O4 in glacial acetic acid at 10(0) C gives N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide. This N-nitrosoacylarylamine is stable at low temperatures (--30 degress C) but unstable at ambient temperature. No intact N-nitroso-2-nitro-4-ethoxyacetanilide can be detected when phenacetin is nitrosated under conditions simulating those in the stomach (37 degrees C, pH 1). Instead, 2-nitro-4-ethoxybenzenediazonium chloride is the main reaction product found. Under the conditions applied, the N-nitrosoacylarylamine rapidly rearranges by 1,3-migration of the acetyl group. The resulting diazoester dissociates into the corresponding diazonium salt. Trapping of the diazonium ion with 1-naphthol as an azo dye provides a useful means to identify the parent N-nitroso compound and to measure colorimetrically its rate of formation. The yields obtained in dilute aqueous nitrosation mixtures are lower than expected; the reasons for this finding are discussed.

The primary proteolytic product, BPA, has a molecular weight similar to or identical with that of the parent protein but yields two large fragments of molecular weight approximately 46000 and 23000 on reduction. Evidence is presented here that cleavage occurs within the disulfide loop between Cys390 and Cys434 with no detectable loss of small peptides, the amino acid composition of BPA being identical with that of the parent protein within experimental error. Cleavage exposes a new amino-terminal phenylalanine residue and may occur at the Glx392-Phe393 bond although the possibility exists that it occurs at another X-Phe bond in the unsequenced region of residues 400-402.

The hydrodynamic volume is increased by approximately 20%. However, various physical studies indicate the tertiary structure to be strikingly similar to that of the native protein. Of most significance is the fact that the protein still undergoes the N-F and N-B transitions, although in both cases they occur at somewhat more moderate pH than in the parent protein. Moreover a sensitivity of the N-B transition to Ca2+ is still seen and binding behavior toward the dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid is essentially unaltered.

An activator of the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-stimulated ATPase present in the human erythrocytes (membrane) has been isolated in soluble form from hemolysates of these cells. Partial purification has been achieved through use of carboxymethyl-Sephadex chromatography. The resulting activator fraction contained no hemoglobin and only 0.3% of the total adenylate kinase activity of the cell. 2. Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it. 2. Whereas the activator was released from erythrocytes subjected to hemolysis in 20 miosM buffer at pH 7.6 or at pH 5.8, only the membranes prepared at pH 7.6 were affected by it. 3. When (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-ATPase activity was measured by 32Pi release from (gamma-32P)ATP, freeze-thawed erythrocytes, as well as membranes prepared at pH 5.8 and at pH 7.6, expressed lower values than noted by assay for total Pi release. When ADP instead of ATP was used as substrate, significant amount of Pi were released by these erythrocyte preparations. Further study revealed (a) production of ATP and AMP from ADP with membranes and hemolysate alone, and (b) exchange of the gamma-and B-position phosphate on (gama-32P)ATP in the presence of membranes plus hemolysates.

An activator of the (Ca2+ plus Mg2+)-stimulated ATPase present in the human erythrocytes (membrane) has been isolated in soluble form from hemolysates of these cells. Partial purification has been achieved through use of carboxymethyl-Sephadex chromatography. The resulting activator fraction contained no hemoglobin and only 0.3% of the total adenylate kinase activity of the cell. 2.

When ADP instead of ATP was used as substrate, significant amount of Pi were released by these erythrocyte preparations.

Catalysis by those systems implies, therefore, that under new space restrictions the groups of the transducing enzyme increase and decrease reactivity between themselves, with activatory and/or inhibitory ligands (H+, H2O, metals, etc.) and with the electron shells of the reactant molecules. The exergonic reaction-dependent turnover of the forms of the enzyme within the transition complexes would be maintained, therefore, under asymmetric phase angles of conformational-dependent reactivity that would effectively restrict the microscopic reversibility of transducing systems. Some well known reactions, such as hemoglobins Bohr effect, can be used to illustrate that microscopic (molecular) interactions subject to thermodynamic equilibria laws may similarly paricipate as driving forces in energy transducing sytems. This would allow the thermodynamic description of the role of proton translocation as that of a modificatory force of the structural parameters of proteins.

We therefore conclude that passive diffusion is not an important mechanism in the renal elimination of PCA in man and that there must be tubular secretion. The implication for the clinical use of the drug is that dose adjustments need not be made in response to variations in urine flow and pH.", "PMID": 1171}

As a result of methionine-192 oxidation the apparent pK of the alkaline transition is shifted from 9 to about 11 at 15 degrees C. This is reflected in the disappearance of the lag phase previously observed for the initial activity of the enzyme when it is incubated at alkaline pH [Eur. J. Biochem. (1973) 39,293-300]. The absence of chemical reactivity of methionine-192 in the alkaline state of the enzyme is confirmed by the appearance of a lag phase in the reaction of the protein with iodoacetate after an incubation at alkaline pH. Such a lag phase does not appear when this incubation is carried out at neutral pH. Since this lag phase is similar to that which shows up in the activity during the isomerization of the enzyme from its alkaline to its neutral state, the present data are interpreted as implying a concerted movement of isoleucine-16 and methionine-192 during this isomerization process. They also indicate that in the alkaline form of the enzyme methionine-192 has moved back into the interior of the protein.

The pI of the Entner-Doudoroff enzyme has been shown to be 5.24 and that of the Zwischenferment 4.27. The Entner-Doudoroff enzyme is stable in the range of pH 6 to 10.5 and shows its maximal activity at pH 8.9. 5. The Entner-Doudoroff enzyme showed specificity for NAD+ as well as for NADP+ and exhibited homotropic effects for D-glucose 6-phosphate. It is inhibited by ATP which acts as a negative allosteric effector. Other nucleoside triphosphates as well as ADP are also inhibitory. 6. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of the axial hydrogen at carbon-1 of beta-D-glucopyranose 6-phosphate to the si face of carbon-4 of the nicotinamide ring and must be classified as B-side stereospecific dehydrogenase.", "PMID": 1257}

With 50mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate, enzymes II and III exhibit plateaus of activity over the pH range 3 - 5 and 3.5 - 6, respectively. Acid phosphatase II is not significantly inhibited by 0.5% formaldehyde. The activity of human liver acid phosphatase II and of human prostatic acid phosphatase towards several substrates is compared. The liver enzyme, is marked contrast to the prostatic enzyme, does not hydrolyze O-phosphoryl choline.", "PMID": 1336}

In phosphate buffer, 6.7 homologous heat-killed cells allowed for the doubling of one S. enteritidis cell. Cryptic growth was not observed when cells were starved on the surface of membrane filters or in suspensions equivalent to 20 mug (dry wt)/ml (105 cells/ml). Similar half-life survival times were calculated for both these populations, but the shape of their survival curves differed significantly. These differences were attributed to stress factors encountered during cell preparation and during starvation. The half-life survival time of S. enteritidis starved at 20 mug (dry wt)/ml was 140 h in phosphate buffer, 82 h in 3,6-endomethylene-1,2,3,-6-tetrahydrophthalic acid buffer, and 77 h in tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer.", "PMID": 1369}

Experiments reported here were directed at asking whether hex-dependent marker efficiency depends on the length of the donor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). In the absence of intracellular competition for hex function, there was no detectable effect of DNA size on hex-dependent marker efficiency as donor DNA was sheared from greater than 1 x 107 daltons to 3.6 x 105 daltons. The latter DNA was purified by two successive velocity fractionations to ensure that the activity seen was representative of DNA of that size. Quantitative examination of the system shows that, for the lethal event hypothesis to be true, the excision step has to remove an average of 7,000 to 10,000 nucleotides.

The appearance an am- colonies was time dependent: a very low frequency (0.3%) at zero time, a maximum (9 to 21%) after 2 to 5 days of growth, and a decline again to low frequencies later in the growth cycle. On agar, cured am- colonies of S. alboniger still produced puromycin. The development of aerial mycelia in S. alboniger, S. scabies, and S. coelicolor was also sensitive to glucose repression. Colonies grown on Hickey-Tresner agar containing 2% glucose remained phenotypically am- throughout the observation period. Adenine (2.5 mM or greater), and to a lesser extent adenosine and guanosine, specifically reversed the repression. The accumulation of undissociated organic acids appears to be involved in glucose repression of aerial mycelia formation.

The post-translational modifications include hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues, glycosylation, folding of the molecule into triple-helical conformation, proteolytic conversion of precursor procollagen to collagen, and oxidative deamination of certain lysyl and hydroxylysyl residues. Any defect in the normal mechanisms responsible for the synthesis and secretion of collagen molecules or the deposition of these molecules into extracellular fibers could result in abnormal fibrillogenesis; such defects could result in a connective tissue disease. Recently, defects in the regulation of the types of collagen synthesized and in the enzymes involved in the post-translational modifications have been found in heritable diseases of connective tissue. Thus far, the primary heritable disorders of collagen metabolism in man include lysyl hydroxylase deficiency in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VI, p-collagen peptidase deficency in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VII, decreased synthesis of type III collagen in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, lysyl oxidase deficency in S-linked cutis laxa and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type V, and decreased synthesis of type I collagen in osteogenesis imperfecta.", "PMID": 1448}

The hydrolysis of all the proteins except fibrinogen and elastin was increased by addition of urea. Various inhibitors of trypsin, kallikrein, plasmin, Clr, Cls, and other proteolytic enzymes had no inhibitory effect. Slight inhibition was observed with polyanethol sulfonate and strong inhibition with normal human serum. Serum of patients with hereditary angioneurotic edema having no functional C1-esterase inhibitor was as effective in inhibiting the proteolysis as normal serum. The inhibitor was localized in 4S fractions of normal serum fractionated on Sephadex G-200. Fractionation of normal serum by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-200 filtration, and CM-Sephadex chromatography did not result in appearance of inhibitory activity in more than one protein peak, suggesting the possibility that only one inhibitor might be responsible. Since all fractions which contained the inhibitor of proteolysis also contained alpha1-antitrypsin, since sera of patients having low alpha1-antitrypsin levels contained less inhibitory activity, and since antibodies against alpha1-antitrypsin reversed the inhibition obtained from normal serum, the inhibition of proteolysis may be attributed to alpha1-antitrypsin.", "contents": "Some properties of proteolysis by polymorphonuclear leukocyte-granule extracts.

It uses plain untreated liquid or powdered milk, requiring no special handling or purification, as binder. Such milk makes it possible to ignore endogenous serum folate binder, since crude (but not purified) milk contains a factor which releases folate from serum binder. It simplifies counting radioactivity by employing a gamma emitting isotope of pteroylglutamic acid (PGA), namely the 125I-tyramide of PGA. Like the 3H-PGA assay of Givas and Gutcho, it permits the use of stable PGA rather than unstable methyltetrahydrofolic acid (MeTHFA) standards, because it is carried out at pH 9.3, a pH at which milk folate binder is unable to distinguish PGA from MeTHFA, which is the predominat folate in human tissues. The equipment required to do the radioassay is present in most diagnostic chemistry laboratories. Results are essentially identical to the generally accepted Lactobacillus casel microbiologic method of folate assay, except that false low results are not produced in the radioassay by antibiotics, tranquilizers, and chemotherapeutic agents.

It was concluded that the action potential was myogenic in origin. 4. The mean frequency of the action potential at 37+/- 0.5 degrees C was 1.0/min+/-0.06 (s.e. of mean, n=92) and the mean duration 7.1+/-0.2 sec (s.e. of mean, n=11). 5. Steady depolarizing current increased whereas hyperpolarizing current decreased the frequency of the action potential. 6. Length-tension relations were studied. In twelve strips, the average resting, passive, tension at LO was 570 mg. The active force of isometric contraction produced by acetylcholine increased with strip length up to a maximum, then decreased wtih further increased in length. There were no mechanical responses to pentagastrin. 7. Pentagastrin had two sites of action. On smooth muscle, it increased the frequency of the action potential in a dose dependent fashion. Threshold concentraions ranged from 2X10-14 to 10-11M. The ED50 was 2X10-10M. The maximum response, 5.4/min, was reached at 10-8M. Pentagastrin also released acetylcholine from intramural cholinergic nerves. 8. Pentagastrin reduced the amplitude and duration of the action potential.", "PMID": 1520}

Nucleoside 5'-diphosphates yield p5N and p8N, nucleoside 5'-triphosphates give p6N and p9N. The prebiological relevance of these reactions is discussed.", "PMID": 1541}

We suggest that a similar set of reactions between abiotically formed amino acids and sugars, and more generally between aldehydes and amines, occurred on a large scale in the prebiotic hydrosphere. The rapid formation of this insoluble polymeric material would have removed the bulk of the dissolved organic carbon from the primitive oceans and would thus have prevented the formation of an \"organic soup\". Melanoidin polymers have several properties which make them attractive hypothetical precursors of contemporary oxidation-reduction coenzymes: 1. they contain heterocyclic nitrogen compounds similar to the nitrogenous bases; 2. they contain a high concentration of stable free radicals; and 3. they tend to concentrate those heavy metals which play prominent roles in contemporary enzymic redox processes. The prebiotic formation of similar polymers could, therefore, have provided the starting point for a basic class of biochemical reactions.

It is suggested that, although the sarcolemmal slow conductance increase was affected by deterioration, the conductance increase is not a direct product of deterioration but it represents a property of the sarcolemma which is encountered in physiological range. The sarcolemmal conductance increase was rather insensitive to the change in pH of Ringer solution. It is inferred that the absence of bellying in newly penetrated intact fibers at neutral and alkaline pHs is caused mainly by the shunting effect of large parallel conductance. Apparent augmentation with EDTA of the sarcolemmal conductance increase infers that Ca ions affect the conductance increase. The conductance increase occurred also in the EDTA-containing Cl-deficient solution. The sarcolemmal slow conductance increase has been compared with the change in Cl conductance reported by Hutter and Warner, and Warner.", "PMID": 1560}

These observations suggest that (a) a major portion of the oleate in the mammary tumor is not produced within the tissue, (b) dietary adaptation is not a general characteristic of stearoyl-CoA desaturase in neoplastic tissues, and (c) enhanced desaturase activity in liver is directly related to the absence of linoleate or oleate, or to a large decrease in oleate in the diet.", "PMID": 1624}

In perifused isolated pancreatic islets alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) or alpha-ketocaproic acid (KC) induced a high insulin secretion rate and a steep increase of the fluorescence of reduced pyridine pyridine nucleotides [NAD(P)H] which fell again to almost prestimulatory levels 6 min after medium change. Insulin release in response to alpha-ketooctanoic (KO) acid started slowly and was accompanied by a decrease of the NAD(P)H-fluorescence trace. Beta-phenylpyruvate which is known to initiate insulin release also caused a fluorescence decrease. Alpha-keto-isovaleric (KIV) acid or pyruvate had no significant effects upon insulin secretion or NAD(P)H-fluorescence. In contrast to l-leucine, l-norleucine or l-valine did not enhance insulin release or fluorescence of NAD(P)H.

A molecular theory of anesthesia is outlined which postulates that release of electrostricted water molecules from the hydrophilic parts of the enzyme due to the protein conformational changes induced by anesthetics is the cause of the decreased luminescence. A similar mechanism is expected to occur at the cell membrane, which probably dehydrates the sodium channel and suppresses the conductance of this ion across the membrane.

An adequate stimulus for the chemoreceptor system in D. discoideum is the change of cAMP concentration in time, rather than concentration per se: long-term binding of cAMP causes only short-term response. The system is, consequently, adapted to the recognition of pulses rather than to steady-state concentrations of cAMP. The ce,lls are, nevertheless, able to sense stationary spatial gradients and to respond to them by chemotactic orientation. The possibility is discussed that they do so by transforming spatial concentration changes into temporal ones, using extending pseudopods as sensors. The cAMP recognition system is part of a molecular network involved in the generation of spatio-temporal patterns of cellular activities. This system controls the periodic formation of chemotactic signals and their propagation from cell to cell. The phosphodiesterase limits the duration of the cAMP pulses and thus sharply separates the periods of signalling; the binding sites at the cell surface are supposed to be the chemoreceptors. The control of cellular activities via cAMP receptors can be studied with biochemical techniques with cell suspensions in which spatial inhomogeneities are suppressed by intense stirring, whereas the temporal aspect of the spatiotemporal pattern is preserved. Under these conditions it can be shown that the extracellular cAMP concentration changes periodically, and that the phase of the cellular oscillator can be shifted by external pulses of cAMP.

The cAMP recognition system is part of a molecular network involved in the generation of spatio-temporal patterns of cellular activities. This system controls the periodic formation of chemotactic signals and their propagation from cell to cell. The phosphodiesterase limits the duration of the cAMP pulses and thus sharply separates the periods of signalling; the binding sites at the cell surface are supposed to be the chemoreceptors. The control of cellular activities via cAMP receptors can be studied with biochemical techniques with cell suspensions in which spatial inhomogeneities are suppressed by intense stirring, whereas the temporal aspect of the spatiotemporal pattern is preserved. Under these conditions it can be shown that the extracellular cAMP concentration changes periodically, and that the phase of the cellular oscillator can be shifted by external pulses of cAMP. It can also be shown that small cAMP pulses induce a high output of cAMP, which demonstrates signal amplification, a function necessary for a cellular relay system.", "PMID": 1814}

This protein has a molecular mass of 150,000, but enzymic digestion yields the Fv fragment of molecular mass 25,000 which still has the combining site intact, as judged by the affinity for dinitrophenyl haptens. Analysis of the e.s.r. spectra of a series of dinitrophenyl spin labelled haptens has allowed the dimensions, rigidity and polarity profile of the combining site to be determined. The combining site is a cleft of overall dimensions 1.1 nm x 0.9 nm x 0.6 nm which has considerable structural rigidity. One of these spin labels has also been used to perturb the n.m.r. spectrum of the Fv and using difference spectroscopy the 270 MHz proton n.m.r. spectrum of the amino acid residues in and around the combining site has been obtained. This spectrum contains only the equivalent of about 30 aromatic and 21 aliphatic protons. Comparison of this difference spectrum with that obtained using a diamagnetic analogue suggests that any conformational changes on hapten binding are mainly localized to the combining site. By the use of (n.m.r.) difference spectroscopy the protons of the three histidine residues in the Fv are observed to titrate with pH and have pKa values of about 8.1, 6.9 and 6.1.

Benorylate can probably penetrate into the synovial membrane like its metabolites salicylate and paracetamol; it remains, however, to be examined whether the metabolites are distributed differently in different synovial areas (active inflamed and unattacked synovial tissue, respectively) in the same way as benorylate per se.", "PMID": 1915}
